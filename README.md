# Zombie Environment Asset - Test Assignment

This repository contains the completed assets and outputs for a test assignment, demonstrating my skills as a 3D artist. The project features a **semi-realistic zombie environment** designed for mobile games, focusing on optimization and high-quality visuals.

---

## Project Overview

- **Theme**: Zombie environment (street section at night).
- **Style**: Semi-realistic, optimized for mobile games.
- **Tools Used**: 
  - Blender (modeling, lighting, and rendering)
  - Substance Painter (texturing)
  - Photoshop (post-processing and additional tweaks)
- **Textures**:
  - **Road texture resolution**: 2048x2048
  - **All other textures**: 1024x1024 (for optimization)
- **Outputs**:
  - Final rendered scene (nighttime view with lighting and details)
  - Wireframe and viewport render views
  - FBX files and textures for reuse or modification.

## Contents of the Repository

1. **FBX Folder**:
   - FBX files for the 3D models.

2. **Textures Folder**:
   - Textures (categorized for easy reference).

3. **Outputs Folder**:
   - Final rendered images.
   - Wireframe and viewport renders.

4. **Readme (this Documentation)**:
   - A brief overview of the design process and decisions.

## Design Notes

- The scene is optimized for **mobile games** with texture sizes kept efficient triangulation can be performed on other assets too if needed.
- Lighting is designed to evoke a **nighttime atmosphere**, suitable for a zombie-themed environment.
- The project adheres to semi-realistic visual standards, balancing detail and performance.

## How to Use

1. Download the repository.
2. Import the FBX files into your 3D application or game engine.
3. Apply the textures from the **Textures** folder.
4. Refer to the rendered outputs for visual reference.
